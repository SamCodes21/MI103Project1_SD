                <h2>Pixel Art</h2>
                <h3>And my love of it.</h3>
                <p>Pixel art is a wonderful medium thatâ€™s constantly being reimagined through new styles and techniques.
                    Down below are some of my favorite examples of pixel art found in various games.
                    Additonally, I'll tell you a little bit about each game and what it means to me.
                    Some pixel art games are all time favorites of mine!

                    <h4>Replaced</h4>
                    <img src="images/replaced-captain.webp" alt="Replaced">
                    <p>Replaced is an upcoming game that immediately caught my eye for it's stunning visuals.
                        The game uses a 2.5D system where it looks like 2D but the player can move around a Z pane
                        in addition to the typical X and Y pane. If you have the time I'd highly recommend checking it out.

                    <h4>Sea of Stars</h4>
                    <img src="images/SeaofStars1.webp" alt="Sea of Stars">
                    <p>Sea of Stars is a more traditional RPG that focuses on turn based combat.
                        The most unique aspect of it though is it's day night cycle that happens in real time
                        and has effects on the gameplay. That cycle accompined by an amazing story and wonderful 
                        characters makes Sea of Stars a top example of how pixel art can enhance a games feel.

                    <h4>Omori</h4>
                    <img src="images/Omori.jpeg" alt="Omori">
                    <p>Omori is one of my favorite games and has one of the most touching and though provoking 
                        naratives of any game I've played. While the pixel art may seem a bit basic in comparison 
                        to the other games listed, don't knock it just for that. The art style really grows on you 
                        and becomes part of the games identity which is incredibly unique on its own.
